## Second Profile has landed!! 🚀

Hello!! My name is Jalin Springer. I'm a year 4 computer science student at Western University. 

I am currently working on creating the backend of a hotel management system in Barbados.

My main tech stack includes react, mySQL, C++, UE5 tools, and the Adobe Creative Suite.

Out of all my projects, the most creative and technical would be my [Ratchet & Clank Project](https://github.com/JSpringer04/ratchet-and-clank-proj2022)
